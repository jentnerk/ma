Applying the recommended capacitance filtering threshold values for 45nm process node: total_c_th=0, relative_c_th=1 and coupling_c_th=0.1.
	These values will be used by all post-route extraction engines, including tQuantus, IQRC and Quantus QRC extraction.
	Capacitance filtering mode(-capFilterMode option of the setExtractRCMode) is 'relAndCoup' for all engines.
	The accuracy mode for postRoute effortLevel low extraction will be set to 'high'.
	Default value for EffortLevel(-effortLevel option of the setExtractRCMode) in postRoute extraction mode will be 'medium' if Quantus QRC technology file is specified else 'low'.

**WARN: (IMPSYT-7328):	The design has been initialized in physical-only mode because the init_mmmc_file global variable was not defined. Timing analysis will not be possible within this session. You can only use commands that do not depend on timing data. If you need to use timing, you need to restart with an init_mmmc_file to define the timing setup, or you can save this design and use restoreDesign -mmmc_file <viewDef.tcl> to add the timing setup information.
